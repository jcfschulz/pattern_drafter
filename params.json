{"tagline":"Simple Program to draw Pattern from Drafting Instructions","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","name":"Pattern Drafter","body":"# About\r\n\r\n# Installing\r\nPattern Drafter is written in Python and therefore requires a Python 2.x interpreter.\r\nFurthermore, you will need the following libraries:\r\n* NumPy & SciPy\r\n* PyGtk\r\n* PyCairo\r\n\r\nIf those libraries are installed, only patter.py, pattern_widget.py and pattern_draw.py from the repository are required.\r\nYou also require the pattern drafting instructions. Currently there is only a basic trouser draft based on Rundschau XVI Ed. Therefore, you should also have the trouser_script file.\r\n\r\n# Basic Usage\r\nThe program can be launched from the commandline via\r\n`python pattern_draw.py`\r\n\r\nThe main screen consists of the pattern canvas, the buttons and a statusbar.\r\n\r\n## Pattern Canvas\r\n### Moving the Canvas\r\nYou can pan the canvas by clicking on an empty part and drag. You can also zoom in with the scroolwheel of your mouse.\r\n### Pattern Elements\r\n* Green lines mark the cutting lines\r\n* Red lines and points are construction lines\r\n* Blue Points and the corresponding lines mark the Bezi√©r controls for the cutting lines\r\n### Altering the Pattern\r\n* You can move the points by clicking on the and dragging. On the statusbar you have information about the position change given in cm.\r\n* The movements are restricted by the drafting macro. Currently there is no detailed description in the program, please refer to the corresponding script (and probably also its original source).\r\n* The draft is updated on the fly according to your changes.","google":""}
