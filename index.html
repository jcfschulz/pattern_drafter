        <h1>About</h1>

<p>PatternDrafter helps you to create custom patterns from drafting instructions.</p>

<p>It is intended for individual tailors and homesewers to speed up the drafting process. It is based on pattern drafts from classic tailoring like this <a href="http://www.cutterandtailor.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=773">Rundschau Trouser Draft</a>, which is also included as a sample script.</p>

<p>I wanted to bring the classic way of drawing a pattern into the computer without sacrificing flexibility. The draft is therefore highly editable, without leaving it's boundaries.</p>

<p>I myself am currently only starting tailoring, so I might not have thought of important points. This is why I call this currently a version 0.0.1 and would be happy to get input from you. But as I also have a fulltime job, I cannot promise anything.</p>

<p>Please feel free to contact me, if you have questions or suggestions: julius.schulz(ät)fu-berlin.de</p>

<h1>Installing</h1>

<p>Pattern Drafter is written in Python and therefore requires a Python 2.x interpreter.
Furthermore, you will need the following libraries:</p>

<ul>
<li>NumPy &amp; SciPy</li>
<li>PyGtk</li>
<li>PyCairo</li>
</ul><p>If those libraries are installed, only patter.py, pattern_widget.py and pattern_draw.py from the repository are required.
You also require the pattern drafting instructions. Currently there is only a basic trouser draft based on Rundschau XVI Ed. Therefore, you should also have the trouser_script file.</p>

<p>You can use the zip and tar balls provided on the page's top. They should include everything.</p>

<h1>Basic Usage</h1>

<p>The program can be launched from the commandline via</p>

<p><code>python pattern_draw.py</code></p>

<p>The main screen consists of the pattern canvas, the buttons and a statusbar.</p>

<h2>Pattern Canvas</h2>

<h3>Moving the Canvas</h3>

<p>You can pan the canvas by clicking on an empty part and drag. You can also zoom in with the scrollwheel of your mouse.</p>

<h3>Pattern Elements</h3>

<ul>
<li>Green lines mark the cutting lines</li>
<li>Red lines and points are construction lines</li>
<li>Blue Points and the corresponding lines mark the Beziér controls for the cutting lines. For more </li>
</ul><h3>Altering the Pattern</h3>

<ul>
<li>You can move the points by clicking on the and dragging. On the statusbar you have information about the position change given in cm.</li>
<li>The movements are restricted by the drafting macro. Currently there is no detailed description in the program, please refer to the corresponding script (and probably also its original source).</li>
<li>The draft is updated on the fly according to your changes.</li>
</ul><h2>The Button Controls</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Load Draft</strong>: Loads a new draft script into the program</li>
<li>
<strong>Load/Save State</strong>: Saves all changes made. This uses the pickle feature of python.</li>
<li>
<strong>Export PDF/SVG</strong>: With this you can save your pattern to either a pdf or svg file; this is based on the ending you give your filename. 
Construction points and lines are included, if they are visible. Beziér controls are never included.
The final result also includes rulers on the top and left side, with 1cm and 5cm marks. This is helpful to ensure proper printing.
Both the pdf and svg are editable in vector graphic programs such as Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape. The cut lines are exported as curves and thus retain their nature and can easily modified in external software.</li>
<li>
<strong>Change Measures</strong>: Input the measures as requested by the draft.</li>
<li>
<strong>Change Extra Parameters</strong>: The drafts can use certain extra parameters, which can alter the draft. The can be edited here. These are raw parameters and you should refer to the draft script as to their meaning.
All changes you made previously will be conserved, if you alter extra parameters.</li>
<li>
<strong>Reset to Measures</strong>: Will remove any manual changes you made in the canvas window. (But not modified extra parameters)</li>
<li>
<strong>Reset View</strong>: Resets Zoom and Position of the canvas to it's initial position.</li>
<li>
<strong>Show/Hide Construction Points</strong>: Hide or Show Construction Points and Beziér controls.</li>
</ul><h1>Printing</h1>

<p>If you want to print the obviously very large output, it may be advisable to tile into smaller pages, that fit your printer.</p>

<p>Software like Adobe AcrobatReader or Adobe Illustrator provide such options in their printing dialogue.</p>

<p>If you are using Linux, the pdfposter package is an option:</p>

<p><code>pdfposter -mA4 -s1 draft.pdf tiled.pdf</code></p>

<h1>Draft Scripts</h1>

<p>Yet to be done</p>

<h1>Licence</h1>

<p>The program is released under <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL v3</a>. This does not hold for the drafting scripts, they are due to their original sources terms.</p>
